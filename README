blink0: genuinely open-source firmware that emulates a Blink(1)

Copyright (C) 2015 Peter Lawrence

based on top of M-Stack USB driver stack by Alan Ott, Signal 11 Software

The author's intent in writing this code is to provide more readable 
firmware source code that can be used in tandem with a bootloader.
This enables the hobbyist/maker to experiment, innovate, and improve 
far more readily than may be possible with the Blink(1).

A open-source PIC16F1454 bootloader by the same author is:
